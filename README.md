# 🍄 Mushroom Classification: Edible or Poisonous?

This project uses **machine learning** to predict whether a mushroom is **edible** or **poisonous** based on its **physical characteristics**. It is built using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes end-to-end data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a classification model that can accurately determine whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on features like:
- Cap shape
- Odor
- Gill size
- Spore print color
- And more...
